## Development Session Summary
**Latest Session: Animal Handle Authentication System**

## Major Updates Made Recently

### 1. Animal Handle Authentication System - NEW ✅
- **Privacy-Friendly User Display**: Dynamic animal-based usernames
  - Generates consistent handles like "CleverFox", "HungryBear" based on user email
  - Uses `unique-names-generator` library for dynamic name generation
  - Same email always generates same animal handle for consistency
  - Replaces real names/emails in UI for enhanced privacy

- **Random Greeting System**: Dynamic welcome messages
  - 13 different cooking-themed greetings rotate randomly
  - Examples: "What's cooking, CleverFox?", "Chef HungryBear!", "Time to ratio, WiseElephant!"
  - Keeps login experience fresh and engaging
  - Maintains fun, community-oriented atmosphere

- **PRD Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive community features planning
  - Updated Product Requirements Document with community recipe discovery
  - Documented transition from personal to community-focused features
  - Added technical implementation details for animal handle system
  - Specified GitHub Secrets for production environment variables

### 2. Phase 2 OAuth Integration - COMPLETE ✅
- **Google OAuth Authentication**: Full user sign-in/sign-out functionality
  - Integration with Google OAuth 2.0 API
  - Persistent user sessions across browser reloads and deployments
  - Clean authentication UI with user profile display

- **PostgreSQL Database Integration**: Supabase-hosted database
  - User data persistence with secure connection strings
  - Recipe storage linked to user accounts
  - Session management and authentication tokens

- **Automatic Recipe Saving**: Seamless recipe persistence
  - All processed recipes automatically saved for logged-in users
  - No manual save action required
  - Background API calls with error handling

- **Recent Recipes Display**: User-specific recipe history
  - Shows last 33 processed recipes per user
  - Quick-access buttons for one-click recipe reprocessing
  - Replaces debug test buttons with personalized content

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX Features
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Click "ratio.ai" header to switch themes
  - Persistent theme preference in localStorage
  - Consistent styling across all components
  - Sky blue accent color maintained in both themes

- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Improved cross-device experience
  - Responsive layout for phones and tablets
  - Touch-friendly interactive elements
  - Consistent user experience across platforms

### 4. Cloud Deployment Infrastructure
- **Google Cloud Run**: Single-service deployment
  - Combined frontend and backend in one container
  - Automatic scaling and high availability
  - HTTPS-enabled public access

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automation
  - Automatic builds on push to main/dev branches
  - Container image builds and deployments
  - Environment variable injection for secrets

### 5. Mobile Device Access Configuration
- **Problem**: App was accessible from PC but not from mobile devices on same network
- **Root Cause**: Frontend hardcoded to use `localhost:8000` for API calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated frontend API calls to use computer's IP address (`192.168.86.51:8000`)
  - Created `.env` file with `HOST=0.0.0.0` to ensure React dev server binds to all network interfaces
  - Added Windows Firewall rules for ports 3000 (frontend) and 8000 (backend)

## Technical Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`src/App.tsx`)
```typescript
// Before:
const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:8000/process-recipe', {

// After:
const response = await axios.post('http://192.168.86.51:8000/process-recipe', {
```

### Network Configuration
- Created `frontend/.env` with `HOST=0.0.0.0`
- Windows Firewall rules added for ports 3000 and 8000

## Current Project Status

### Phase 1 Features (Complete) ✅
✅ Recipe URL processing and ingredient extraction  
✅ Ratio calculations with color-coded categories  
✅ Ingredient editing with real-time ratio updates  
✅ Loading screen with video animation  
✅ Mobile device access from same network  
✅ Error handling and loading states

### Phase 2 Features (Complete) ✅
✅ Google OAuth user authentication  
✅ PostgreSQL database integration (Supabase)  
✅ Automatic recipe saving for logged-in users  
✅ Recent recipes display (last 33 per user)  
✅ Dark/light theme toggle  
✅ Mobile-responsive design  
✅ Google Cloud Run deployment  
✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions  
✅ Session persistence across deployments

### Live Deployment
- **Production URL**: Available on Google Cloud Run
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with secure connections
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 integration
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically

### Local Development Architecture
- **Frontend**: React dev server on `0.0.0.0:3000`
- **Backend**: FastAPI server on `0.0.0.0:8000`
- **Mobile Access**: Available at `http://192.168.86.51:3000`
- **API Endpoints**: Accessible at `http://192.168.86.51:8000`

### Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows with PowerShell
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with virtual environment
- **Firewall**: Windows Defender with custom rules for ports 3000, 8000

## Usage Instructions for Mobile Testing

1. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Connect mobile device to same WiFi network as PC
3. Access app at: `http://192.168.86.51:3000`
4. Extract ratios functionality now works cross-device

## Firewall Configuration Commands Used
```cmd
# Run as Administrator
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="React Dev Server Port 3000" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Backend Server Port 8000" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000
```

## Development Credits Usage
- **Current Session**: 685/2500 credits used this month
- **Efficiency Note**: Focused approach reduced unnecessary command executions after initial debugging
