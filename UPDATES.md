# ratio.ai Updates - August 3, 2025

## Development Session Summary
**Warp Credits Used: 685/2500 this month**

## Major Updates Made Today

### 1. Mobile Device Access Configuration
- **Problem**: App was accessible from PC but not from mobile devices on same network
- **Root Cause**: Frontend hardcoded to use `localhost:8000` for API calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated frontend API calls to use computer's IP address (`192.168.86.51:8000`)
  - Created `.env` file with `HOST=0.0.0.0` to ensure React dev server binds to all network interfaces
  - Added Windows Firewall rules for ports 3000 (frontend) and 8000 (backend)

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- **Loading Screen**: Changed background from white to black for better visual experience
- **Main App Background**: Updated to sky blue (`#87CEEB`) for improved aesthetics
- **Video Animation**: Maintained 7-second loading video with proper fade transitions

### 3. Network Configuration Files Added
- `frontend/.env`: Contains `HOST=0.0.0.0` for proper network binding
- Backend already configured to bind to `0.0.0.0:8000` via `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)`

## Technical Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`src/App.tsx`)
```typescript
// Before:
const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:8000/process-recipe', {

// After:
const response = await axios.post('http://192.168.86.51:8000/process-recipe', {
```

### Network Configuration
- Created `frontend/.env` with `HOST=0.0.0.0`
- Windows Firewall rules added for ports 3000 and 8000

## Current Project Status

### Working Features
✅ Recipe URL processing and ingredient extraction  
✅ Ratio calculations with color-coded categories  
✅ Ingredient editing with real-time ratio updates  
✅ Mobile device access from same network  
✅ Loading screen with video animation  
✅ Debug test recipe buttons  

### Network Architecture
- **Frontend**: React dev server on `0.0.0.0:3000`
- **Backend**: FastAPI server on `0.0.0.0:8000`
- **Mobile Access**: Available at `http://192.168.86.51:3000`
- **API Endpoints**: Accessible at `http://192.168.86.51:8000`

### Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows with PowerShell
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with virtual environment
- **Firewall**: Windows Defender with custom rules for ports 3000, 8000

## Usage Instructions for Mobile Testing

1. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Connect mobile device to same WiFi network as PC
3. Access app at: `http://192.168.86.51:3000`
4. Extract ratios functionality now works cross-device

## Firewall Configuration Commands Used
```cmd
# Run as Administrator
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="React Dev Server Port 3000" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Backend Server Port 8000" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000
```

## Development Credits Usage
- **Current Session**: 685/2500 credits used this month
- **Efficiency Note**: Focused approach reduced unnecessary command executions after initial debugging
